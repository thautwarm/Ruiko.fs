---------------

``RBNF`` is an extended EBNF which could describe grammars formed by arbitrary rules.

It has a tiny core abstraction which is orthogonal and complete,
as a consequence, it's made by very few constructs.
All the conventions exported by ``RBNF`` are natural, rational and easy to get along with.
